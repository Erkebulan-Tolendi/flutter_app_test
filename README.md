# flutter_application_test
This project is a simple mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to browse a list of courses, view detailed information about each course, and manage course data. Users can view course titles, descriptions, and images, with data stored in a local SQLite database. The app also supports adding, updating, and deleting courses, ensuring smooth navigation between screens and a clean, responsive UI.
